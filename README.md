# Copy Find Results

This adds the ability to copy the results of a "Find In Project" search to your
clipboard and opens the copied text in a new buffer.

You can either copy the results in `JSON` or a "Sublime Text"-like `text` format.

It can be invoked via the **Command Palette** or the **Context Menu** if you're
perusing a results buffer.

Additionally, you can setup your keymap to call either `copy-find-results:text`
or `copy-find-results:json`.
